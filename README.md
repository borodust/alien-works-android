# alien-works-android

Support code for [`alien-works`](https://github.com/borodust/alien-works) for android. Dropping this module into an android project and wiring it into an actual application should be simple enough. Hopefully, this ends up as easy as just using `AlienWorksActivity` w/o any tinkering.
